# Slope Stability Analysis with Bishop Method
### Program in python and visualizer in C#
### Use grid search for circular slip surface

### Define slope shape
### Define soil parameters: friction angle, cohension, and unit weight
### Define an m*n center grid interval spacing
### Set upper bound, lower bound and increment of radiuses of slip surfaces
### Tabular & graphical outputs: potential slip surfaces, the failure surface and corresponding safety factors
